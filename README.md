# happy-kaktus
Scrap news from `mujkaktus.cz` and publish them on a Telegram channel

This script is periodically run by a GitHub action and whenever
there is some new news on the website, it republishes it into a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/kvetinac).

The purpose is to find out when do the *happy hours* occur. In general, they occur twice per month, around 8th and 23th, between 17 and 20 hours.
